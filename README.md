1. Graphic primitives and canvas

Drawing three primitives: lines, rectangles, circles,
Specifying drawing parameters using a text field (entering parameters into text fields and confirming with a button),
Drawing using a mouse (defining characteristic points with clicks),
Moving using a mouse (grabbing, for example, an edge and dragging),
Changing shape/size using a mouse (grabbing characteristic points and dragging),
Changing shape/size using a text field (selecting an object and modifying its parameters using a text field).
With enabled shift u can change size of primitive

2. Smoothing (averaging) filter,
Median filter,
Edge detection filter (Sobel),
Dilation,
Erosion.

4. 
Defining and drawing arbitrary figures - polygons using a mouse or text fields,
Performing the following transformations on created figures:

Translation by a given vector,
Rotation around a given point by a specified angle,
Scaling with respect to a given point by a specified factor,
Figures should be grabbable using a mouse
All operations should be possible to perform using both a mouse and text fields:
Translation - using a mouse and after entering a vector and confirming,
Rotation - defining a rotation point using a mouse and through text fields, performing rotation using a mouse (grabbing and rotating) and by entering and confirming the rotation angle in a text field,
Scaling - defining a scaling point using a mouse and through text fields, performing scaling using a mouse (grabbing and scaling) and by entering and confirming the scaling factor in a text field,
The ability to serialize and deserialize (saving and loading), so that it is not necessary to redraw figures from scratch each time the program is launched.

Press right click on mouse to connect all points.
